I'll create a simpler, more compatible version that should work without errors.I've created a much simpler version that should work without errors:

1. **Removed all fragment animations** - These can cause issues in some environments
2. **Simplified the HTML structure** - No complex nesting or special characters in attributes
3. **Used an older, stable version** of Reveal.js (4.1.0)
4. **Removed all advanced features** - Just basic slides with simple styling
5. **Minimal initialization** - Only the essential configuration

The presentation now has 22 straightforward slides without any complex JavaScript interactions. You should be able to navigate with:
- Arrow keys (left/right/up/down)
- Space bar (next slide)
- ESC (overview mode)
- F (fullscreen)

This stripped-down version should work reliably across different browsers and environments.
