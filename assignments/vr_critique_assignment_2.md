# Critique 2: Comparative VR Analysis
### Due: Week 9 - Thursday at 11:59 PM
### Weight: 12% of Final Grade
### Peer Reviews Due: Sunday 11:59 PM

## Overview

For your second critique, you'll conduct a comparative analysis of multiple VR experiences, demonstrating your evolved understanding of VR design principles. This assignment challenges you to synthesize knowledge from the course and identify design patterns across different approaches.

## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast different VR design philosophies
- Identify emerging patterns in VR interaction design
- Evaluate trade-offs in design decisions
- Develop professional-level critique skills

## The Experiences

You'll analyze TWO contrasting VR experiences:

### Primary Experience: **I Expect You To Die 3**
**Platform:** Quest 3 ($29.99 or free trial)  
**URL:** https://www.meta.com/experiences/i-expect-you-to-die-3/  
**Playtime:** 30-45 minutes (first 2 missions)  

### Comparison Experience: Choose ONE
1. **Puzzling Places** - Meditative puzzle design
2. **Walkabout Mini Golf** - Social VR design
3. **Pistol Whip** - Rhythm action design
4. **Your Unity Showcase** - Peer project comparison

## Assignment Structure

### Part A: Comparative Framework Setup (45 minutes)

Play both experiences with this comparative lens:

**Analysis Categories:**
1. **Interaction Philosophy**
   - Object manipulation approach
   - UI/UX paradigms
   - Player agency levels

2. **Comfort Design**
   - Locomotion solutions
   - Comfort options provided
   - Accessibility features

3. **Narrative Integration**
   - How story drives mechanics
   - Environmental storytelling
   - Player role definition

4. **Technical Innovation**
   - Unique VR solutions
   - Performance optimizations
   - Platform-specific features

### Part B: Video Essay Production (7-10 minutes)

#### Structure

**1. Thesis Statement (0:00-0:45)**
- Your central argument about VR design
- Preview the comparison
- State why this comparison matters

**Example Thesis:**
> "While both experiences use hand-based interaction, I Expect You To Die 3's seated design and Puzzling Places' room-scale approach represent fundamentally different philosophies about player comfort and agency in VR."

**2. Individual Analysis (0:45-3:30)**
- 90 seconds per experience
- Focus on unique strengths
- Establish baseline for comparison

**3. Comparative Analysis (3:30-7:00)**

Use the **COMPASS Framework**:

**C** - **Contrast** the Approaches
- How do they differ?
- What trade-offs did designers make?

**O** - **Observe** Patterns
- What common solutions emerge?
- Which standards are forming?

**M** - **Measure** Effectiveness
- Which approach works better for what?
- How do you define "success"?

**P** - **Project** Applications
- When would you use each approach?
- What can other designers learn?

**A** - **Assess** Innovation
- What's genuinely new?
- What's iteration on existing ideas?

**S** - **Synthesize** Insights
- What universal principles emerge?
- How does this advance VR design?

**4. Design Recommendations (7:00-8:30)**
- Specific improvements for each
- Hybrid approach possibilities
- Future design implications

**5. Conclusion (8:30-9:00)**
- Summarize key insights
- Connect to course concepts
- Provocative final thought

### Part C: Advanced Production Requirements

#### Required Techniques
- **Split-screen comparisons** showing both experiences
- **Overlay graphics** highlighting differences
- **Chapter markers** for easy navigation
- **Cited sources** for any claims
- **B-roll footage** for pacing

#### Professional Elements
- **Lower thirds** for terminology
- **Transition consistency** between sections
- **Color coding** for each experience
- **Audio normalization** across clips
- **Motion graphics** for data/stats (optional)

### Part D: Peer Review Process

Reviews should demonstrate your growth since Critique 1.

#### Advanced Review Criteria (300+ words)

1. **Thesis Strength (25%)**
   - Is the argument clear and defendable?
   - Does evidence support claims?

2. **Comparative Depth (35%)**
   - Are comparisons meaningful?
   - Do they reveal insights?

3. **Technical Understanding (25%)**
   - Appropriate use of terminology?
   - Accurate technical assessments?

4. **Production Evolution (15%)**
   - Growth from Critique 1?
   - Professional presentation?
