# Critique 1: Foundational VR Analysis
### Due: Week 5 - Thursday at 11:59 PM
### Weight: 8% of Final Grade
### Peer Reviews Due: Sunday 11:59 PM

## Overview

For your first critique, you'll analyze a carefully curated VR experience that demonstrates fundamental VR design principles. This assignment introduces you to critical analysis of VR-specific features while building your vocabulary for discussing spatial interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and articulate VR-specific design elements
- Develop vocabulary for discussing spatial experiences
- Practice video essay production skills
- Engage in constructive peer review

## The Experience

### **First Hand** by Meta
**Platform:** Quest 3 (Free)  
**URL:** https://www.meta.com/experiences/first-hand/5030224183773255/  
**Playtime:** ~20 minutes  

First Hand is Meta's hand-tracking showcase that demonstrates core VR interaction paradigms. It's perfect for learning to identify and discuss fundamental VR mechanics.

### Why This Experience?

First Hand provides clear examples of:
- Hand tracking vs. controller input
- Object manipulation in 3D space
- Spatial UI/UX principles
- Haptic feedback design
- Comfort-first locomotion
- Audio spatialization

## Assignment Structure

### Part A: Gameplay & Recording (30 minutes)

1. **Setup**
   - Download First Hand directly on Quest 3 (not PC)
   - Enable recording via Share button
   - Test both hand tracking AND controller modes

2. **Structured Playthrough**
   - Play the complete experience (~20 min)
   - Take screenshots of key interactions (Share button → Screenshot)
   - Make notes using this observation framework:

   **Observation Framework:**
   - **What** is the interaction? (describe objectively)
   - **How** is it implemented? (technical approach)
   - **Why** might it be designed this way? (design intent)
   - **When** does it work well/poorly? (context)
   - **Who** might struggle with this? (accessibility)

3. **Recording Management**
   - Use Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH) to transfer video
   - Enable "Sync Large Files" in MQDH settings for files >500MB
   - Save raw footage before editing

### Part B: Video Essay Production (5-7 minutes)

Your video essay should follow this structured format:

#### 1. Hook & Context (0:00-0:30)
- Start with your most interesting observation
- State your analytical focus
- Preview what you'll discuss

**Example Opening:**
> "What if I told you that removing controller buttons actually makes VR more intuitive? First Hand proves this counterintuitive claim through its hand-tracking design..."

#### 2. Experience Overview (0:30-1:30)
- **Developer Context:** Meta Reality Labs' goals
- **Core Mechanics:** What players do
- **Design Philosophy:** Accessibility-first approach
- **Technical Innovation:** Hand tracking technology

#### 3. Deep Dive: Two VR Interactions (1:30-5:00)

For EACH interaction (~1.5-2 minutes each), use the **IDEA Framework**:

**I** - **Identify** the Interaction
- Name it specifically (e.g., "pinch-to-grab mechanic")
- Show clear footage of it in action
- Describe what the player does

**D** - **Demonstrate** Implementation
- How does the technology work?
- What feedback systems support it?
- Compare hand tracking vs. controller versions

**E** - **Evaluate** Effectiveness
- Does it achieve its apparent goal?
- How does it feel to use?
- What makes it succeed or fail?

**A** - **Analyze** Impact
- How does this affect presence?
- Does it increase or decrease immersion?
- Who benefits/struggles with this design?

**Required Interactions to Analyze:**
1. Choose ONE manipulation mechanic:
   - Pinch-to-grab objects
   - Two-handed scaling
   - Precision placement
   
2. Choose ONE feedback system:
   - Haptic patterns
   - Visual hand ghosting
   - Audio confirmation cues

#### 4. Critical Reflection (5:00-6:00)
- What surprised you about these interactions?
- How do they compare to traditional gaming?
- What would you change and why?
- Who is the target audience?

#### 5. Conclusion (6:00-6:30)
- Summarize key insights
- Connect to broader VR design principles
- End with a thought-provoking question

### Part C: Production Requirements

#### Technical Specifications
- **Duration:** 5-7 minutes (strict limit)
- **Resolution:** Minimum 1080p
- **Audio:** Clear narration (use script!)
- **Footage:** Must include YOUR gameplay

#### Required Elements
- Title card with your name and assignment
- Gameplay footage illustrating each point
- At least 3 screenshots or freeze-frames with annotations
- Captions for technical terms
- End card with references

#### Editing Techniques to Use
- **Picture-in-Picture:** Show multiple angles
- **Slow Motion:** Highlight specific gestures
- **Annotations:** Circle or arrow important elements
- **Split Screen:** Compare hand tracking vs. controllers
- **Audio Ducking:** Lower game audio during narration

### Part D: Peer Review Process

After submission, you'll review 2 classmates' critiques.
