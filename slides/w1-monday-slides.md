**About the Experience**

Uncanny Alley: A New Day is an award-winning live VR theater production by Ferryman Collective and Virtual Worlds Company. This cyberpunk-infused narrative blends gaming interactivity, live performance, and VR, challenging audiences to consider the meaning of leaving home.

**Narrative Summary**

Set in a dystopian future, a group of protesters escapes imprisonment with the help of hacker Gh0st and her sentient Service-Bot, Atom. As they navigate a decaying city controlled by Adaptive Learning Industries, participants must choose whether to flee to a new metaverse or stand and fight for their home. The experience is highly interactive, with audience decisions influencing the journey through dynamic locations and live improvisational performances.
