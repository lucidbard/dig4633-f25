# Basic Building Tutorial

## Step 1: Create Your Foundation
1. Open the **Library** panel
2. Drag a **Platform** into the scene
3. Scale it using the transform tools (R for scale)
4. Apply a material from the Materials library

## Step 2: Add Basic Geometry
Shortcuts:
- Q - Select tool
- W - Move tool
- E - Rotate tool
- R - Scale tool
- F - Focus on selected
- Ctrl+D - Duplicate
- Delete - Remove object

## Step 3: Create Your First Interaction
1. Select an object
2. Open **Script Mode**
3. Add event: "When player enters trigger volume"
4. Add action: "Play sound" or "Change color"
5. Test in Play Mode (P key)

# Visual Scripting Essentials

## Core Concepts

**Events (Green):**
- Player enters area
- Object is grabbed
- Timer completes
- World starts

**Actions (Blue):**
- Move object
- Play sound
- Change color
- Spawn object

## Your First Script: Color Change on Approach
1. Create a cube
2. Add a **Trigger Volume** around it
3. Script: When Player Enters → Set Color (cube) to Random
4. Add second action: Play Sound Effect

> **Challenge:** Make the cube also rotate when triggered!

---

# Common Horizon Patterns

## Teleportation Pads
- Use invisible trigger volumes
- Action: "Teleport Player To" target object
- Add particle effects for feedback

## Collectibles
- Object + Trigger Volume
- When collected: Destroy self + Add to variable
- Update UI counter

## Moving Platforms
- Use "Move To" action with loop
- Set waypoints with empty objects
- Adjust speed for comfort

## Day/Night Cycle
- Rotate directional light over time
- Lerp sky color values
- Trigger events at specific times

> **Remember:** Start simple! Get one mechanic working before adding complexity.

# Tips for Your Dreamscape

## Design Principles

**✨ Make it Impossible**
- Waterfalls flowing upward
- Infinite corridors
- Nested spaces
- Impossible geometry

**🎯 Guide the Player**
- Use lighting as wayfinding
- Create visual landmarks
- Sound cues for direction
- Clear sight lines

## Performance Tips
- Keep object count under 1000
- Use instances for repeated objects
- Limit particle effects
- Test frequently in Play Mode

## Avoid These Pitfalls
- Overcomplicating your first world
- Forgetting player comfort (avoid spinning rooms!)
- Making spaces too large and empty
- Not testing before publishing
